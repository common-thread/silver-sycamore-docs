## 2) Answering Phones

This position acts as the first point of contact for our guests. Whether they are coming by in person, or calling on the phone - you are the first person they talk to. Always greet the customer with a smile and use polite, professional language. Here's the proper way to answer the phone:

> "Good Morning/Afternoon, thank you for calling Silver Sycamore. My name is _________, how may I assist you?"

## Guest Check-In Process

When a guest arrives for check in it is imperative to receive a payment.
- If the reservation is made through bedandbreakfast.com, log into the account and physically check the guest in
- If the reservation is made through rezovations or booking.com a credit card must be present unless they are paying with cash. In that event, a credit card still needs to be on file for incidental charges. (i.e. if something is broken or taken from the room)

After a guest checks out you will need to send a review request via email. See Silver Sycamore> Events> Review Request Script
