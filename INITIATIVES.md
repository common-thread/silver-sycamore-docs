## Status Sync Architecture

Future enhancement: Each project repo will maintain a STATUS.md file that serves as source-of-truth for current progress. The dashboard (this repo) will pull from those status files to keep INITIATIVES.md synchronized.

**Planned STATUS.md locations:**
- `wedding-package-contract-generator/STATUS.md`
- `pine-street-cafe-recipes/STATUS.md`
- `silver-sycamore-docs/STATUS.md`
