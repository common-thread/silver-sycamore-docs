## Cash Drawer Policy

**End of shift cash handling procedures**

### Critical Requirements:

1. **Servers cannot leave until cash drawer has been counted and all cash and receipts are accounted for**

2. **Servers will be required to make up any shortage from their cash tips before leaving for the day**

3. **Each server must have a printed copy of each paid receipt for guest tickets that will be matched to the corresponding order from the kitchen printer**
   - Ensures reconciliation between guest payments and kitchen orders
   - Prevents discrepancies and missing payments

## Guest Check Payment Policy

**Revised: 08-26-20**

### Payment Processing Protocol

1. **Servers must find out if guest check is to be split BEFORE taking orders**
   - Critical timing for split check management

2. **Servers must use first initial of first and last name before table numbers on tickets**
   - Example: JS-2
   - Ensures proper attribution and tracking

3. **Servers will process/print split check orders as follows:**
   - Send Initials, Table Number, (Seat) # of guests, A, B, C, etc. depending on number of guests
   - Example for a table of 4, all splitting separately:
     - JS-4a, JS2-4b, JS2-4c, JS2-4d

4. **When it's time to print the guest check/bill, look over the entire order to make sure you have charged for everything correctly**
   - **You will be held responsible for all items not paid at the end of your shift**

5. **Present the bill to the paying guest(s) let them know you will take their payment at the table when they are ready**
   - Table-side payment expectations

6. **ALL CREDIT/DEBIT card payments must be completed by the server, on your tablet, not at the front counter**
   - You are NOT BY THE FRONT DOOR
   - Server is responsible for swiping their credit/debit card and ensuring the payment has processed
   - You must verify with a printed receipt card

7. **If a guest is paying CASH, take their payment to the register, cash out the guest ticket and count your change TWICE before returning change to the guests**
   - Bring the payment to the register
   - Cash out the guest ticket
   - Count your change TWICE
   - Return change to guests
