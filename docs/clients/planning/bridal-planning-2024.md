| Note: At Silver Sycamore we generally do not recommend assigned seating unless you believe you will max out capacity at 200 guests. You have several options for seating at our venue. 1) All open seating 2) A few reserved tables for close family or 3) An assigned seat for each guest. It's completely up to you! By entering each name into a cell below your total number of head table party members and total guests not sitting at the head table will total for you. These numbers should match your confirmed guest RSVPs once you have assigned each person a seat. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
