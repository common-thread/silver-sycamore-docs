# Checklist 4 6 Months

4-6 Months Out:

Now that the DJ and Catering have been settled, and Save-the-Dates have been sent out. It’s time to talk desserts!
- Bridal Cake: Most Silver Sycamore packages include the Bridal Cake. Our cake vendor is **Cakes by Jula** in League City. If you would like to schedule your complimentary tasting and design consultation, then you can contact **Jula** at **832-932-1353.**
- Invitations: We recommend getting your invitations from the same vendor you went with for your Save-the-Dates. You want them to have a consistent theme.
- Decorations: Included in your package is the ability to use centerpieces from our _“Something Borrowed”_ room. To schedule an appointment, please contact our coordinators at sycamorebrides@gmail.com. For a wider variety of decorations, we recommend reaching out to **Angela** with **Davenport Designs.** She offers chargers, arches, and beautiful centerpieces to fit any style! You can reach her at **281-908-2112** or email her at ddevents.rentals@gmail.com.
- Tuxedo & Formal Wear: For menswear, 4-6 months out is a sufficient time for renting tuxedos and formal wear. This also includes time for alterations if needed, so be sure to ask them to get fitted in this time frame.
- B&B/Hotel Accommodations: If you are traveling from out of state, or simply want to enjoy a relaxing stay before/after your wedding then this is the time to start booking. **Silver Sycamore** offers 4 cottages and 4 hotel rooms to choose from! If you want to book your stay with us, then do so as soon as possible while rooms are available.
- Bridal Shower: Usually this is the time when your family or bridesmaids host your bridal shower. Be sure to check with us about our Shower Packages! (You’ll receive **$50.00 off** your balance for any shower referrals) Don’t forget to send out thank you notes for all wedding and shower gifts!
- Honeymoon: You’ll want to give yourself enough time to book flights and get hotels in order. Contact **Gillian Chatman** with **Chatman Destinations** for help planning the perfect honeymoon! You can contact her at **877-638-6877 EXT 700** or chatmandestinations@gmail.com
- Accessories: Now is the time to purchase a ring pillow, toasting flutes, cake service set, garter, guest book, or picture frames. Silver Sycamore has a few of these items, so check out our Something Borrowed room for many wedding items!
