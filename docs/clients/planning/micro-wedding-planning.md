We will schedule a coordinator to be here with you throughout your wedding day, and add a second team member before the ceremony. **If you are "Venue Rental Only" , please be prepared to bring your own Team for all set up*** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Please see the additional reminders BELOW the yellow box, and complete the yellow box. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| There are so many spaces at Silver Sycamore for children to wander around. Please give name and contact number of who would be in charged overall of children |  | ****This is Required***** |  |  |  |  |  |

|  | -If you have booked for Rental Only remember Dessert plates, napkins, and silverware are NOT provided by the caterer unless you have made arrangements with them prior to the wedding. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | - Please be sure your vendors are aware that setup and pickup must fall in the rental period. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Decorating: | Please share these notes with your decorating team: |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | - Decorating is NOT stressful unless you choose an easily stressed out person to lead the decorating process. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | - Decorating happens quickly and easily when you setup one or two sample tables completely. Then, everyone helping knows what to do without asking lots of questions. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | - On average, it seems that approximately 5 friends/family members help decorate unless a florist is heavily involved. We have had some instances of 2 or 3 people decorating with a simple setup, and literally instances of 30+ friends and family helping with a big setup. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | - On average, decorating takes about an hour if using linens provided by Silver Sycamore , and about an hour and a half if outside linens are used. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | - If you have rented linens from Silver Sycamore, they will be on the tables when you arrive. If you have rented napkins, they will also be on the table. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
