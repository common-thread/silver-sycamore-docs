# Checklist 9 12 Months

9-12 Months Out:

We are now down to less than a year away! Just stopping by to go over a few more things that you should be thinking about around this time for your wedding.

\-Bridal Shops and Formal Gowns: Most bridal shops order brand new gowns for every bride that they get the opportunity to work with. The only downside to this is the amount of time it takes for a new dress to be constructed and tailored just for you. This process can take anywhere from 6-16 weeks, and if you are also shopping for bridesmaids, consider the time it takes for them too!

\-Photographer/Videographer: Now is the time to find your photographer and videographer. Be looking around for certain styles that you like. It is best to have the same photographer for your engagement and bridal shoots, as well as the day of the ceremony and reception. This will help build that personal relationship, which will help the photographer when getting those personal shots. Silver Sycamore does have a list of Preferred Photographers. We recommend **Dream Photo and Video** (contact **Shiva** at **713- 885-3878**) or **His and Hers Foto** (contact **Oscar** at **832-385- 9828**).

\-Bed and Breakfast: If you want to block out all of the bed and breakfast rooms for your wedding night, now is the time to contact Silver Sycamore and get that taken care of. We require a **50%** deposit to save the rooms.

\-Order and send out Save-The-Dates to help your guests make arrangements for the BIG day.
