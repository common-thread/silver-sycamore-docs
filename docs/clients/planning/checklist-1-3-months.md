# Checklist 1 3 Months

1-3 Months Out:

Congratulations! It’s only a few months away! Here is some advice on what to do next:

\-Beauty and Make-Up: Now is the time to hire your make-up artist. Remember everyone has schedules, so they will need to know the time and date in advance. Silver Sycamore does recommend **Mayra Malik** with **Simple Beauty**. You can call her at **832-276-8668** or email her at [info@simplebeautyartistry.com](mailto:info@simplebeautyartistry.com)[](mailto:info@simplebeautyartistry.com)

\-Guest List: Exactly **tw****enty one days** **out** is the date when we at Silver Sycamore need your **final guest list**. This is so we can provide appropriate seating and food for all your guests. We’ll be calling you to schedule your two week out appointment to get this information and go over all the details for your wedding!

\-Documents and Records: That’s right. It’s time to get that Marriage License! You can find all the forms you need at www.missnowmrs.com. The Knot also has packages where they will take care of changing your name too!

\-Fresh Flowers: Confirm Florist orders if you are having fresh flowers for centerpieces and for your bouquets/boutonnieres.

\-Bachelorette & Bachelor Party: And now it is time to let go of all the planning and relax. Leave the planning of these festivities in the capable hands of your Maid of Honor and Best Man!

\-Music: Sit down with the groom to finalize the music playlist for your ceremony and reception and select the order of how you will want your bridal party introduced to the reception. A copy of your music selection is **DUE** at your **2 weeks out** appointment.

\-Rehearsal Dinner: This is your chance to enjoy quality time with your friends and family before the big day. Silver Sycamore offers Rehearsal Dinner packages for after your rehearsal.. How convenient would it be to not have to rush to your restaurant reservation the day before your big day!
