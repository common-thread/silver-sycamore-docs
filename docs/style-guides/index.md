## Design Philosophy

The Editorial Archive design system draws inspiration from scholarly publications and archival documents. Core principles:

1. **Warmth** - Avoid cold whites; use warm off-whites and champagne accents
2. **Readability** - Generous typography sizing for comfortable all-day reading
3. **Refinement** - Subtle interactions and transitions, never jarring
4. **Timelessness** - Classic typographic hierarchy that ages well

## Shared DNA

All variants share these foundational elements:

- **Typography**: Playfair Display (display) + DM Sans (body)
- **Palette**: Ink (text), Paper (backgrounds), Champagne (accents)
- **Philosophy**: Typeform approachability meets editorial magazine layouts
