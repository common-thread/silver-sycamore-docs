Well let's we set up an appointment to come tour our grounds and go over packages in greater detail does that sound good?

We like to make it when both the Bride and Groom and anyone else making this major decision can attend. So when is best for all to attend. Weekdays or Weekends?

We have appointments available at _____ and _____ which works best for you?

**get date, time, Contact number and email..**

Alright we have you set for: DATE..... Time..... (Reiterate appointment info) and you will be meeting with Jackie

We will send a text and email reminder the day before your tour. If you cannot make it please let us know as soon as possible because we stay booked for appointments.

In the meantime, be thinking about details of what "Your Perfect Wedding" looks like because I know Jackie will be asking you this during your appointment.

Let me explain where the office is on the grounds:

When you turn onto the grounds, you will drive towards the town "Sycamoreville" and park there. You come to the "Post Office" building and the Tour office is in there.

We look forward to seeing you. Thank you and have a nice day.
