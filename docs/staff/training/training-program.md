### Team Culture

By day 5 you should be a well-trained waiter or waitress. The one thing we cannot train is your kindness and caring for people. However, that is expected, so bring that in with you every day.

If you feel by the 3rd day you are not going to get it or just do not like being a waiter or waitress, please let us know. It will not hurt our feelings. If you are not happy doing what you do, our guests will feel it too.

We do not just want happy guests. We want a happy team!

We are excited to have you as part of the Silver Sycamore Team!
