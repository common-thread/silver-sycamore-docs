## This Session (2026-01-19)

1. **v1.3 Milestone Completion**
   - Created MILESTONES.md entry
   - Archived phases 24-28 to `.planning/milestones/v1.3/phases/`
   - Updated PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md
   - Created git tag v1.3 and pushed

2. **Auth Removal**
   - Removed all Clerk packages (@clerk/backend, @clerk/nextjs, @clerk/testing, @convex-dev/auth)
   - Simplified ConvexClientProvider to plain ConvexProvider
   - Updated middleware to passthrough
   - Removed auth redirects from pages
   - App now runs without authentication

3. **Brand Adherence Fixes**
   - Card.tsx: `borderRadius: 0` → `var(--radius-lg)` (8px rounded)
   - Badge.tsx: `borderRadius: 0` → `var(--radius-full)` (pill shape)
   - Badge.tsx: Replaced hardcoded colors with CSS tokens (warning, info, accent)

4. **Brand Section & Documentation**
   - Added "Brand" nav menu (replaced "Style Guide")
   - Created `/brand` landing page
   - Created `/brand/recipe-app` and `/brand/wedding-app` style guide pages
   - Created `/deliverables/recipe-app` and `/deliverables/wedding-app` documentation
   - Updated deliverables page with consistent button order

5. **Screenshots Infrastructure**
   - Moved screenshots to `.planning/screenshots/`
   - Updated screenshot-pages.ts with new routes (25 total)
   - Documented convention in CLAUDE.md

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Known Issues (Minor)
- Hydration mismatch warnings on /style-guide, /components, /guides (pre-existing, from Select/Input random IDs)
- Document viewer Clerk auth error when auth disabled (pre-existing, doesn't affect current use)

## Future Considerations
- Style Guide page uses its own CSS module, Components page uses actual components - potential drift
- Consider merging Style Guide to use actual components for single source of truth

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Auth removal**: Complete removal rather than toggle - simpler for current Guest Mode focus
- **Brand nav**: Single "Brand" menu containing all style guides vs separate nav items
- **Screenshot location**: `.planning/screenshots/` for consistency with planning artifacts
- **Documentation structure**: Each app gets both `/deliverables/{app}` (features/tech) and `/brand/{app}` (style guide)

</decisions_made>

<context>
Project is in good state post-v1.3. Wiki content is transposed, navigation is context-based, auth is removed for Guest Mode development. Ready to discuss next milestone (v1.4 or v2.0).

Options for next milestone:
1. Deploy to production hosting
2. Restore features from feature/full-v1 branch
3. User acceptance testing with staff
4. Binary file preview (docx, xlsx, pdf)
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:discuss-milestone` or `/gsd:new-milestone` to plan next work.

Or if continuing polish work:
- Fix hydration warnings in Select/Input components
- Consider merging Style Guide to use actual components
