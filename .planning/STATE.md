- Portable brand package at .planning/brand-package/

### Next Steps

Phase 13-01 complete. Options:
1. **`/gsd:plan-phase 14`** — Plan next phase (Technical Polish)
2. **`/gsd:consider-issues`** — Review deferred issues with fresh context
3. Continue with other phases as needed

### Deferred Architecture Issues

Nav/routing architecture concerns were identified but deferred:
- Nav/routing architecture may need refinement for content scope
- Some pages may have legacy structure issues

These can be addressed in Phase 14 (Technical Polish) or as a separate insert phase if urgent.
