# Milestone v1.1: Content Pipeline & Branding

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-16
**Phases:** 12-15
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

Fix content import reliability, establish company-wide branding standards, and apply them consistently across the UI. Evolved from MVP to polished, branded experience.

## Phases

### Phase 12: Content Pipeline

**Goal**: Deterministic content seeding - parse index.md tables for document titles/descriptions instead of heuristic extraction
**Depends on**: v1.0 complete
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: Index.md parser with import script integration

**Details:**
- Parser utility extracts document metadata from all 5 index.md files (64 entries)
- Import script uses parsed metadata as primary source with heuristic fallback
- 62 of 65 documents now use authoritative metadata

### Phase 13: Brand Foundation

**Goal**: Establish the Silver Sycamore brand kit: design tokens, in-app style guide, and logo integration
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 13-01: Logo system, design tokens, style guide, brand package

**Details:**
- 4 logo variants: Full, Icon, Text, Horizontal (4000x1000)
- Design tokens: ink/paper/bronze palette, Playfair/DM Sans typography
- Style guide page at /style-guide
- Portable brand package at .planning/brand-package/

### Phase 14: UI Cleanup

**Goal**: Apply brand foundation to clean technical artifacts from UI
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01: Consolidate navigation into flat feature-based row
- [x] 14-02: Clean document viewer and catalog page

**Details:**
- Merged two navigation tiers into one flat nav row (9 items)
- Brand bar: Logo, Staff Hub label, Search, Notifications, User
- Removed Type column from catalog
- "Pending conversion" message for binary files

### Phase 15: Custom Dropdowns

**Goal**: Replace native HTML select elements with styled dropdown components
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 15-01: Create Select component and replace all native selects

**Details:**
- Custom Select with search, keyboard nav, 180ms animations
- Replaced 4 native selects: ShareDialog, FormRenderer, FieldEditor, FormBuilder
- Style guide showcase with all variants

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Index.md as source of truth for document metadata (heuristic fallback)
- Font pairing: Playfair Display (display) + DM Sans (body)
- Horizontal logo user-designed, required artifact cleanup
- Brand bar for identity only, nav row for all features
- Auto-search when select options > 5 items

**Issues Resolved:**
- Content seeding no longer uses heuristics (was 0/65, now 62/65 authoritative)
- Technical indicators removed from document viewer
- Native selects replaced with branded components

**Issues Deferred to v1.2:**
- Folder/document creation broken
- Form builder overhaul (visual sections like Google Forms)
- Forms in workspace (not just docs)
- Universal comments with @mentions
- First-principles content architecture refactoring
