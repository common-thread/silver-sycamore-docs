# Phase 7: Folder Sharing - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Users can share their personal folders with others by clicking a share button that opens a Google Drive-style modal. In the modal, they pick people (or create ad-hoc groups) and choose a permission level: View, Comment, or Edit.

Recipients see shared folders in a "Shared with me" section, making it easy to find what's been shared with them. The sharing experience should feel familiar and intuitive — no hunting for settings or confusion about who has access.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Easy to share** — Sharing should be quick and obvious, Google Drive-style modal with people picker
- **Clear permissions** — Always obvious who has access and what they can do (View / Comment / Edit)
- **Finding shared content** — Recipients easily find shared folders in a dedicated "Shared with me" area

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- Three permission tiers: View (read-only), Comment (add notes without editing), Edit (full access)
- Share with individuals by name OR create ad-hoc groups on the fly
- Google Drive-style UI: share button opens modal, people picker, permission dropdown
- "Shared with me" section for recipients to find shared content

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This builds on Phase 6's personal workspace. Users now have folders and documents — sharing lets them collaborate without losing ownership. The Comment tier is particularly useful for getting feedback without giving full edit access.
