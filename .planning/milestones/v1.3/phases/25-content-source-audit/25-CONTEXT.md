# Phase 25: Content Source Audit - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A comprehensive, efficient audit that covers all angles in one pass. Look at everything — every source file, every format, every potential issue — but do it quickly without getting bogged down.

The audit should combine:
1. **Complete inventory** — every source file cataloged with format and current state
2. **Problem identification** — markdown rendering issues, misclassifications, structural problems
3. **Gap analysis** — missing content, redundant files, incomplete docs

Also pull in accumulated context from previous roadmaps and planning documents (v1.0-v1.2) to ensure full coverage of known issues and decisions that affect content.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Full coverage** — nothing missed, every source file accounted for
- **Actionable clarity** — know exactly what needs to change and why
- **Connected picture** — see how content relates, what's redundant, what's missing
- **Quick wins surfaced** — easy fixes vs harder work clearly distinguished
- **Efficient execution** — comprehensive but fast, not getting lost in details

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- Cross-reference against previous planning documents (v1.0, v1.1, v1.2 roadmaps)
- Include known issues already identified in milestone retrospectives
- Account for the 12 content type misclassifications noted in v1.2
- Check content against the style guide established in v1.2

## Additional Context

This audit feeds directly into Phase 26 (Transposition Process Design). The more complete the picture here, the better the methodology will be.

From STATE.md: "Markdown content was imported but never properly transposed for the UI context. The style guide exists but documents weren't analyzed for their intent and how they should be presented within the app."
