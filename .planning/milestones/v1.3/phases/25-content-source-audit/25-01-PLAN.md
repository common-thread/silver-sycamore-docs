<objective>
Comprehensive content source audit covering all markdown files, navigation structure, and rendering context to identify exactly what needs transposition.

Purpose: Create actionable inventory of content issues so Phase 26 can design the transposition methodology with complete information.
Output: AUDIT.md with prioritized transposition recommendations, gap analysis, and quick-win identification.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Generate complete source file inventory</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/25-content-source-audit/AUDIT.md (partial)</files>
  <action>
Create comprehensive inventory of all source files in `docs/`:

1. **List all 74 markdown files** with metadata:
   - Path, filename, file size
   - Category (from directory structure)
   - Content type (from Phase 18 CONTENT-TRACKER.md)
   - Has frontmatter (yes/no)
   - Word count estimate

2. **List all 6 index.md files** separately:
   - These are category navigation pages
   - Note their structure (tables vs prose)

3. **Cross-reference against Phase 18**:
   - Verify all 70 classified documents are still present
   - Identify any new files added since Phase 18
   - Flag the 12 content type misclassifications noted in v1.2-ROADMAP.md

4. **Document navigation mapping**:
   - How `docs/` categories map to current nav items
   - Which nav items lead to which content

Write initial sections of AUDIT.md:
- File Inventory (by category)
- Index Files Analysis
- Navigation Mapping
  </action>
  <verify>AUDIT.md exists with File Inventory section containing 74+ entries</verify>
  <done>Complete inventory of all source files with metadata, cross-referenced against Phase 18</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Analyze rendering issues and style compliance</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/25-content-source-audit/AUDIT.md (continued)</files>
  <action>
For each category of content, analyze rendering context and style compliance:

1. **Markdown rendering analysis** - Sample 3-5 docs per category, check for:
   - Headings rendered correctly (H1/H2/H3 hierarchy)
   - Tables displaying properly
   - Lists rendering (numbered, bulleted)
   - Links working (internal cross-references)
   - Special markdown (callouts, blockquotes, code blocks)
   - Front matter being stripped vs displayed

2. **Style guide compliance** - Check against Staff Hub variant:
   - Typography: Are docs using prose-appropriate styling?
   - Information density: Too sparse or too dense?
   - Status colors: Used appropriately?
   - Procedure styling: Steps numbered correctly?
   - Reference styling: Tables scannable?

3. **Intent vs presentation mismatch** - Key question from STATE.md:
   - Is content written for "print/static" but displayed in interactive app?
   - Are procedures missing step-by-step UI treatment?
   - Are references missing quick-scan formatting?
   - Are index files serving as proper navigation?

4. **Cross-document consistency**:
   - Inconsistent heading levels across similar docs
   - Varied formatting for same content types
   - Naming convention inconsistencies

Add to AUDIT.md:
- Rendering Issues (by severity: breaking, degraded, cosmetic)
- Style Compliance Report
- Intent-Presentation Mismatches
  </action>
  <verify>AUDIT.md has Rendering Issues and Style Compliance sections</verify>
  <done>All content categories analyzed for rendering and style issues</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create prioritized transposition recommendations</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/25-content-source-audit/AUDIT.md (complete)</files>
  <action>
Synthesize findings into actionable recommendations:

1. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Missing content (referenced but doesn't exist)
   - Incomplete documents (stubs, placeholders)
   - Outdated content (references to old systems, dates)
   - Orphaned content (exists but not linked)

2. **Redundancy Report**:
   - Confirm/update Phase 18's 18 redundant items
   - Any new duplicates discovered
   - Resolution recommendations

3. **Prioritized Transposition List**:

   **Priority 1 - Quick Wins** (low effort, high impact):
   - Documents needing only minor formatting fixes
   - Front matter additions
   - Simple restructuring

   **Priority 2 - Medium Effort**:
   - Documents needing content restructuring
   - Type misclassifications to correct
   - Cross-reference fixes

   **Priority 3 - Heavy Lift**:
   - Documents needing significant rewriting
   - Content that needs merging or splitting
   - Major structural changes

4. **Transposition Scope Summary**:
   - Total documents needing changes
   - Estimated effort by priority tier
   - Recommended approach for Phase 26

Complete AUDIT.md with:
- Gap Analysis
- Redundancy Report (updated)
- Prioritized Transposition List
- Scope Summary for Phase 26
- Recommendations section

  <verify>AUDIT.md is complete with all sections, Priority tiers populated</verify>
  <done>AUDIT.md provides complete, actionable picture of transposition needs</done>
