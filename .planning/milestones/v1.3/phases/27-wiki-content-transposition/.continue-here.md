<context>
Phase 27 is the main transposition execution - applying the methodology designed in Phase 26 to all wiki documents.

Key references for continuing:
- `.planning/phases/26-transposition-process-design/METHODOLOGY.md` - step-by-step transposition process
- `.planning/phases/26-transposition-process-design/TEMPLATES.md` - visual specs for 5 content types
- `.planning/phases/25-content-source-audit/AUDIT.md` - document inventory and classifications

Wave 2 is the largest wave with 5 parallel plans covering procedures, references, checklists, and forms.

<next_action>
Resume with: `/gsd:execute-phase 27`

This will detect plans 01-02 are complete (have SUMMARYs), skip to Wave 2, and spawn 5 parallel agents for plans 03-07.
