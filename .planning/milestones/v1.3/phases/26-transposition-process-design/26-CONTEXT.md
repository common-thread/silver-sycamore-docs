# Phase 26: Transposition Process Design - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A template-driven approach to content transposition. Create visual presentation templates for each content type (procedures, references, checklists, guides, forms), then systematically apply them to all 62 documents identified in the audit.

Key principle: **No holes or laziness** — every document gets handled. Include a fallback template for documents that don't fit neatly into a content type or where classification confidence is low.

The process should be systematic but not rigid. When I'm unsure about a document's intent or how to apply a template, I ask for clarification rather than guessing or skipping.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Consistency across content types** — Every procedure should look and feel like every other procedure. Staff should know what to expect when they open a document of a given type.
- **Intent preservation** — The original purpose of each document must come through clearly, even after visual transformation. Don't lose the message while polishing the presentation.
- **Complete coverage** — All 62 documents get transposed. Fallback template catches anything that doesn't fit cleanly.

## Specific Ideas

- Use the Staff Hub style guide as the foundation for templates, but treat it as guidance not mandate
- If a document's purpose is better served by deviating from the style guide, the document wins
- Style guide itself can evolve based on what we learn during transposition
- Speed matters but not at the expense of consistency or intent — "good enough" is acceptable, but systematic is required

## Additional Context

User is available to clarify when classification or application is uncertain. The process doesn't need to be bulletproof — it needs to be systematic with an escape hatch to the user for edge cases.

Decisions pending from Phase 25 audit:
- Form duplicate strategy (deprecate vs redirect vs keep)
- Index.md fate (integrate vs convert vs remove)
- 6 content type reclassifications to confirm
