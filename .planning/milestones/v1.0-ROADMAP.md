## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Typography: Playfair Display (display) + DM Sans (body)
- Color palette: Ink/paper/bronze system
- Authentication: Convex Auth with Password provider
- Role hierarchy: staff → manager → admin
- Channel types: public/private/dm with real-time subscriptions
- Form ownership model with public submission endpoint

**Issues Resolved:**
- Playwright auth persistence (solved with storageState approach)
- E2E testing with Clerk (test user seeding + sign-in tokens)

**Issues Deferred to v1.1:**
- Content seeding pipeline needs deterministic parsing from index.md tables
- Remove technical indicators (file type labels, emojis) from document viewer
- Custom dropdowns to replace native HTML select elements

**Technical Debt:**
- Import script uses heuristic description extraction instead of parsing index.md
- "Document preview coming soon" placeholder for binary files
