# Milestone v1.3: Wiki Content Transposition

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 24-28
**Total Plans:** 18

## Overview

Transform raw markdown into properly contextualized wiki content that adheres to the style guide and makes sense within the app UI. Defer secondary features to a branch. Replace type-based navigation with context-based organization.

## Phases

### Phase 24: Feature Branch Extraction

**Goal**: Move deferred features (comments, messaging, forms builder, procedures, checklists) to a separate branch, simplify main codebase
**Depends on**: v1.2 complete
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 24-01: Branch Creation + Auth Toggle (Wave 1)
- [x] 24-02: Messaging + Notifications Extraction (Wave 2)
- [x] 24-03: Interactive Content Simplification (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 24-04: Forms + Comments Extraction (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 24-05: Navigation Cleanup + Verification (Wave 3)

**Details:**
- Created `feature/full-v1` branch preserving complete feature set
- Implemented auth toggle (NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTH + BYPASS_AUTH) for Guest Mode
- Simplified navigation to wiki-only features
- Verified app runs without authentication

### Phase 25: Content Source Audit

**Goal**: Investigate all source files (markdown, JSON), catalog formats, identify what needs transposition
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 25-01: Content Source Audit (Wave 1)

**Details:**
- Cataloged 111 source files (74 markdown, 37 binary)
- Categorized rendering issues (breaking, degraded, cosmetic)
- Analyzed style compliance against Staff Hub variant
- Created prioritized transposition list (62 documents)
- Identified 6 content type reclassifications

### Phase 26: Transposition Process Design

**Goal**: Create methodology for analyzing document intent and conversion to UI context
**Depends on**: Phase 25
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 26-01: Transposition Process Design (Wave 1) [has checkpoint]

**Details:**
- Resolved checkpoint decisions: forms (keep), index files (remove), reclassifications (5 approved)
- Created TEMPLATES.md with visual specifications for 5 content types + fallback
- Created METHODOLOGY.md with step-by-step transposition process
- Established batch execution order with effort estimates

### Phase 27: Wiki Content Transposition

**Goal**: Apply transposition methodology to all wiki documents (62 docs + 7 removals)
**Depends on**: Phase 26
**Plans**: 8 plans

Plans:
- [x] 27-01: Cleanup - Remove index files and recipe-app README (Wave 1)
- [x] 27-02: Services Frontmatter - Add metadata to 13 services docs (Wave 1, parallel)
- [x] 27-03: Procedures - Transpose 9 procedure docs + 2 reclassifications (Wave 2)
- [x] 27-04: Client References - Transpose 18 layouts and timelines (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 27-05: Operations References - Transpose 5 operations docs + 2 reclassifications (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 27-06: Checklists - Transpose 7 checklist docs + 1 reclassification (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 27-07: Forms - Transpose 9 form documentation docs (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 27-08: Heavy Lift - Handle 4 large/problematic files (Wave 3)

**Details:**
- 62+ documents transposed with proper frontmatter
- 6 index files removed (type-based navigation sufficient)
- 2 heavy lift files removed (catering-sign-up.md, tasting-form.md)
- 2 heavy lift files truncated to policy references (bridal/micro wedding planning)
- 5 content type reclassifications applied

### Phase 28: Navigation Refinement

**Goal**: Replace type-based navigation with context-based organization (Events, Services, Operations)
**Depends on**: Phase 27
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 28-01: Backend Query + ContextCatalog Component (Wave 1)
- [x] 28-02: Context Pages - Events, Services, Operations (Wave 2)
- [x] 28-03: Header Update + Visual Verification (Wave 3)

**Details:**
- Created `byCategories` Convex query for context-based filtering
- Built ContextCatalog component with type filter chips
- Created Events, Services, Operations pages with context-appropriate content
- Updated Header navigation to context-based
- Converted legacy routes (/procedures, /references, /checklists, /guides) to redirects

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Forms: Keep all 18 with type=form (catalog reference, not fillable)
- Index.md: Remove all 6 files (type-based navigation sufficient)
- Reclassifications: 5 approved (procedure/reference/checklist changes)
- Recipe-app README: Remove from docs/ (deliverable, not documentation)
- Heavy lift: Remove spreadsheet dumps, truncate planning docs to policies
- Context-based navigation: Events (client), Services (pricing), Operations (staff)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Raw markdown displayed without UI context adaptation
- Type-based navigation didn't match user mental model
- Heavy files (70KB+) bloating wiki

**Issues Deferred:**
- Document viewer Clerk auth error when auth disabled (pre-existing from Phase 24)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
