<context>
Phase 06 introduced personal workspace for users to create their own documents
and copy wiki content for private annotation. The workspace is accessible via
/workspace route and "My Workspace" link in header. Users can organize with
nested folders, and the editor auto-saves changes.

Next phase (07) will add sharing capabilities so users can share their personal
folders with other users or groups.
