# Phase 28: Navigation & Catalog Refinement - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Navigation should be organized by work context — Events, Operations, Services (or whatever structure emerges from the content itself) — with content type (procedure, reference, checklist, form, guide) as a secondary filter within each context.

The current navigation is legacy from before the transposition work and doesn't reflect how the 62+ documents are now organized. It needs a fresh look based on what the content actually is.

Staff access content in three different modes:
1. **Task-oriented:** "I need to set up for a wedding" → know what they're doing, get to the document fast
2. **Browse/discover:** "What do we have for corporate events?" → exploring what's available in a context
3. **Quick reference:** "Where's that timeline template?" → know it exists, find it instantly

Navigation should support all three modes: context groupings for browsing, type filters for task-oriented access, search for quick reference.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Logical groupings** — Content organized in a way that makes intuitive sense, no hunting for things
- **No duplication** — Each document appears in ONE place, no confusion about which is the "real" one
- **Fast access** — Most-used documents are never more than 2 clicks away

All three are equally critical. This phase needs to deliver on all of them.

## Specific Ideas

- Think from first principles based on the content as a whole — don't assume the existing source structure is correct
- Current nav is legacy and "a lot is wrong with it" — fresh analysis needed
- Context-based groupings as primary organization (Events, Operations, Services or similar)
- Content type as secondary filter within each context
- Avoid redundancy between nav items and type filters

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is the final phase of v1.3 Wiki Content Transposition. All 62+ documents have been transposed with proper frontmatter and content types. The nav/catalog work should leverage that metadata.

Phase 27 outcomes that inform this work:
- 5 content types properly tagged: procedure, reference, checklist, form, guide
- 6 index files removed (type-based navigation now sufficient)
- Heavy lift files resolved (removed or truncated)
- All documents have consistent frontmatter

The goal is making the navigation actually reflect the transposition work — the content is now properly categorized, the navigation should surface that.
