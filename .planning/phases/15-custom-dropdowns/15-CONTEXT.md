# Phase 15: Custom Dropdowns - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Every native HTML select element in the app gets replaced with a custom-styled dropdown component that feels premium and intentional. When a user opens a dropdown, it should feel like using a high-end editorial interface — smooth, polished, and consistent with the ink/paper/bronze brand foundation.

The dropdowns should be both beautiful AND functional. Not just a visual upgrade, but a UX upgrade: keyboard navigation that feels native, search/filter for longer lists, clear selection affordances. The full package with no compromises.

The frontend-design skill should orchestrate this — bringing the same level of craft that went into the rest of the design system.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual polish** — Premium editorial feel, Playfair/DM Sans typography, ink/paper/bronze palette
- **Seamless interaction** — Smooth animations, perfect keyboard navigation, feels native but better
- **Smart features** — Search/filter within options, clear selection, all the conveniences users expect

All three equally important. No cutting corners on any dimension.

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — trust the frontend-design skill to make it excellent. Continue the Typeform-inspired aesthetic already established in the design system.

## Additional Context

User wants the frontend-design skill to "masterfully orchestrate" this phase. High expectations for craft and polish. This is about replacing every native select in the app, so consistency and reusability matter.
