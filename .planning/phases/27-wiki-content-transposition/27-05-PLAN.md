```
- Format as table with Day | Task columns
- Add intro explaining schedule purpose
- Remove procedural language ("do X then Y") - just list the tasks

**training-schedule.md:**
```yaml
---
title: Training Schedule
description: Day-by-day training curriculum overview
contentType: reference
---
```
- Format as table with Day | Topic | Duration columns
- This is a schedule reference, not step-by-step procedure
