<current_state>
ALL work from subagent must be reverted. The subagent bypassed the MANDATORY /frontend-design skill requirement for BOTH tasks. The entire plan (Tasks 1-2) requires the skill.

The user explicitly rejected all improper work: "You're not accepting any subpar work."
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Nothing valid - all work must be redone using the skill
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- **FIRST: Full revert of all improper work:**
  ```bash
  # Revert the logo commit
  git revert --no-commit 81add9b

  # Discard uncommitted Task 2 work
  git checkout -- app/src/app/globals.css app/src/app/layout.tsx
  rm -rf app/src/app/style-guide/

  # Commit the revert
  git commit -m "revert: undo improper 13-01 work (skill not used)"
  ```

- Task 1: Copy logo assets and create Logo component - MUST USE /frontend-design SKILL
- Task 2: Create style guide - MUST USE /frontend-design SKILL
- Task 3: Human verification checkpoint

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Rejected ALL subagent work because it violated mandatory skill requirement
- Both Task 1 (logos) AND Task 2 (style guide) require /frontend-design skill
- Full revert required, then redo everything properly
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- Commit 81add9b (logo work) needs to be reverted
- Dirty working tree with improper Task 2 work needs cleanup
</blockers>

<context>
The plan (13-01-PLAN.md) has extensive mandatory enforcement for the /frontend-design skill:
- Frontmatter: `invoke_skills: ["frontend-design"]`
- <skill_usage> section with warnings
- Task name: "Task 2: Create style guide (MUST use /frontend-design skill)"
- Done criteria requires skill invocation
- Success criteria requires skill invocation

User's words: "You're not accepting any subpar work."

The /frontend-design skill should:
1. Analyze current globals.css
2. Reference wedding project's champagne palette (#C9B896, #E5DFD1, #A69A7A)
3. Fix "fonts too small" issue - make readable and warm
4. Create comprehensive /style-guide page with logo, colors, typography, components
5. Maintain Typeform-inspired archival/editorial aesthetic
</context>

<next_action>
1. Run full revert:
   ```bash
   # Revert logo commit
   git revert --no-commit 81add9b

   # Discard uncommitted Task 2 work
   git checkout -- app/src/app/globals.css app/src/app/layout.tsx
   rm -rf app/src/app/style-guide/

   # Commit the revert
   git commit -m "revert: undo improper 13-01 work (skill not used)"
   ```

2. Invoke /frontend-design skill for the ENTIRE plan (Tasks 1 + 2):
   ```
   /frontend-design Execute plan 13-01 for Silver Sycamore staff hub brand foundation.

   Plan: .planning/phases/13-brand-foundation/13-01-PLAN.md

   Task 1: Copy logo assets from wedding project, create Logo.tsx component with variants
   Task 2: Evolve design tokens in globals.css, create /style-guide page

   Context:
   - Wedding project logos: /Users/splurfa/projects/clients/silver-sycamore-deliverables/wedding-package-contract-generator/public/
   - Wedding color palette: champagne (#C9B896, #E5DFD1, #A69A7A)
   - Fix font readability (currently too small)
   - Aesthetic: archival/editorial, Typeform-inspired, warm not stuffy
   ```

3. After skill completes, run `bun run build` to verify

4. Proceed to Task 3 (human verification checkpoint)
