# Phase 13: Brand Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

This is the birthing of the official Silver Sycamore brand kit and design system. We establish the visual foundation that everything else builds on — design tokens (CSS custom properties), in-app style guide documentation, and proper logo integration.

The direction is archival/editorial, Typeform-inspired: serif fonts, paper/ink aesthetic, scholarly feel. But executed with warmth and clarity — fonts that are readable, not tiny. Refined and polished like a wedding venue, but not stuffy or formal.

The wedding style guide provides the color palette baseline (monochrome + champagne accents). Typeform's actual site provides the design language reference. The frontend-design skill synthesizes these into a cohesive brand kit that cascades into all subsequent UI work.

Process: Brand kit first → visual review → iterate based on feedback.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual clarity** — Readable, comfortable, nothing strains the eyes. Fix the "too tiny" problem in current implementation.
- **Color coherence** — Wedding palette properly integrated. Champagne accents feel intentional, not random.
- **Logo presence** — Silver Sycamore identity is clear throughout. Proper placement, spacing, usage guidelines.

All three are equally essential — they're the foundation everything else builds on.

## Specific Ideas

- Start with wedding style guide color codes — those are the company brand colors
- Reference Typeform's site equally for design language (not just colors)
- Frontend-design skill creates the brand kit; user reviews visually (screenshot/local) and provides feedback
- Design tokens as CSS custom properties that can cascade throughout the app
- In-app style guide documentation page showing logo usage, colors, typography

</specifics>

## Additional Context

**Restructured from original roadmap:** Original phases 13-15 were:
- Phase 13: UI Cleanup
- Phase 14: Design Tokens
- Phase 15: Style Guide

This didn't make sense — you need the foundation before you can apply it. New structure:
- Phase 13: Brand Foundation (design tokens + style guide + logo assets)
- Phase 14: UI Cleanup (apply brand to clean technical artifacts)
- Phase 15: Custom Dropdowns (apply brand to form elements)

**Source assets:**
- Wedding style guide has the company color codes
- Logo assets need to be copied from wedding project

**Current state issue:** The Typeform-inspired direction is correct, but execution has fonts that are too small. This phase fixes that by establishing proper tokens with warmth and readability.
