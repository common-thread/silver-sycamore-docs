# Phase 21: Form Builder Visual Rebuild - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When someone builds a form, they see visual section cards they can drag around — like Google Forms. Each field type appears as a card you can reorder by dragging. No modals. When you click a card to edit it, everything happens inline right there. You're always looking at your form structure, never at a modal obscuring your view.

It should feel simple and familiar. Google Forms is the reference — it gets out of the way and lets you just build. Add a field, type the question, done. The current modal-heavy approach feels clunky; this should feel fast and frictionless.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Speed of creation** — Building a form should feel fast and frictionless. Add fields, done.
- **Visual clarity** — Always see the form structure clearly, no confusion about what you're building.
- **Direct manipulation** — Drag, drop, click, type. Everything happens where you expect it, inline.

All three are equally essential. This is the trifecta of a good builder experience.

## Specific Ideas

- Visual section cards like Google Forms — each field as a draggable card
- Inline editing only — no modals, edit right where you click
- Google Forms is the north star for feel: simple, familiar, gets out of the way
- Should fit within the existing brand aesthetic (Typeform-inspired design system)

## Additional Context

Current form builder uses modals heavily, which feels clunky and breaks the flow. The rebuild is about removing that friction entirely — everything visible, everything editable in place.

The existing forms system works (17 legacy forms seeded in v1.0), so this is about UX improvement, not functionality rebuild.
